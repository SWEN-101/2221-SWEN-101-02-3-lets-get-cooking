Marigold Parson(she/they)
I graduated from Brookville Area Jr/Sr High School in May of 2022
I love music, video games, and I also crochet! I also love games like Dungeons and Dragons and Magic the Gathering, where I spend way too much money on things that do not matter.

Graduated from Stuart Hall High School (Staunton, VA) in 2022. As for hobbies, programming? maybe, until I get it burned out of me by college; otherwise, not much. My favorite food is pink lemonade (a drink, not a food, but go with it).
